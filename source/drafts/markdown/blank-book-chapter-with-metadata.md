# IN THE CAT-BIRD'S NOOK. 



In a secluded nook in a certain park many-hours of last summer were passed in the absorbing study of the manners of the cat-bird. 

So well hidden was that delightful spot, so narrow and rough the gate, and so attractive the shaded walk leading away from it, that it might have remained a secret to this day, unknown save to the birds and the squirrels; but a friendly cat-bird in a moment of confidence led me behind the veil of thick shrubs which screened it from intrusive visitors. I marked well the entrance, and day after day returned, at all hours, to study his ways in his chosen home. Each day's knowledge increased my respect and liking, no less than my surprise and indignation at the prejudice against him. 

The morning our acquaintance began I had been watching his movements as he flitted about, now running madly across the walk, as though a legion of enemies were after him, now pausing on the edge to see what I would do next, then retiring to a short distance under the trees, and having a lively frolic with last year's leaves, digging into them with great spirit, and throwing them far over his head. Suddenly he rose on wing, and flew, with tail wide spread, across the walk into an althea bush, where he disappeared. 

I was about to pass on, when, fancying I heard a faint twittering in the shrub, I approached quietly till near enough to put my hand on him, before T saw him. There he sat on a branch about as high as my head, looking at me very sharply with his intelligent black eyes, but not in the least agitated. I stood still, and he went on with his song. It was a most extraordinary performance. The sweetest solo given with every trill and turn the bird can execute, with swelling throat and jerking tail, yet not a note louder than a whisper! I had to listen to catch the sound, although I could touch him where I stood. It was a genuine soliloquy. When he had finished he flew out the other side of the bush, and pushing my way between the althea and a close-growing wigelia, I found myself in his nook, a charming sunny spot, running down to the lake. 

Though burdened with an undeserved and offensive name, and having somehow become an object of suspicion and dislike to many persons, the cat-bird — Mimus carolineyisis — is one of the most intelligent and interesting of our native birds. No bird makes closer observation, or more correctly estimates one's attitude toward him. As I sit motionless in his nook he will circle around me, hopping from bush to bush, at a distance of ten or twelve feet, looking at me from every side, and at last slip behind a low shrub, and come out boldly upon the grass with an unconcerned air, entirely different from that with which he had kept me under surveillance for the last ten minutes. 

The cat-bird has an inquiring mind; nothing escapes his eye, and everything is of interest to him. Far from being satisfied to accept anything as "mysterious," he wishes and intends to know the why and the wherefore of everything new or strange. After one has gained  his confidence, to induce him to show himself on the grass it is only necessary to place there something new — a bit of paper, a small fruit, or anything unusual. From behind his screen of leaves he sees it, is at once seized with intense curiosity, and if not afraid he will almost instantly come down to inspect it. This he does by trying to stab it with his sharp black bill, jumping off the ground and pouncing on it, when it happens to be hard, till one fears he will break his bill. A bit of apple treated by him is full of minute stabs or gashes like dagger thrusts. His manner, however, is not one of vulgar curiosity, but always of philosophical inquiry into the nature of substances, and his look is as grave and thoughtful as though he were studying some of the problems of human or bird life. 

He has also a sense of humor. I had the fortune to see from my own window in the city an amusing exhibition of this quality. Hearing the sweet song of a cat-bird, I seized an opera-glass and looked over the neighboring yards till I found him perched on the roof of a pigeon-house, singing with great energy. Several pigeons were also on the roof, and seemed interested in the stranger entertaining them, stupidly — in pigeon fashion — walking about and looking at him, turning their heads from side to side in their mincing way. Suddenly, in the middle of a burst of song, the minstrel darted like a flash among them (evidently for pure fun, for he did not touch one of them) and returned instantly to his song. Wild panic, however, seized the pigeons, and although he was a mere atom among them, they flew every way, and would have shrieked with terror had he been able. 

Then the sparrows began to observe him. They gathered near, in a cherry-tree and a lilac bush, chattering and scolding, and plainly questioning the right of the stranger to intrude upon their grounds. After a while one of them flew rapidly past the apparently unconcerned cat-bird, who interpolated one scolding note, without pausing in his song. This insult not being resented, the sparrow grew bolder, returned, and alighted on the roof near him. Wishing to finish his song, the cat-bird merely scolded a little, and put himself in a threatening attitude, when the sparrow considered it prudent to retire. For a few minutes there was great chattering in the cherry-tree, and the birds, having made up their minds that he could do nothing but scold, plainly resolved to mob him in true sparrow fashion. One led the way by flying down to the roof about two feet from the cat-bird, all bristled up ready for fight. This was too much ; the song ceased, and with a fearful war-cry the singer fairly flung himself after that sparrow, who disappeared in a panic, and the whole party of mobbers with him. They very evidently appreciated their mistake, and saw that the stranger was willing as well as able to take care of himself, for neither sparrow nor pigeon came near him again, and when he returned to his perch, light as a feather and unruffled as a summer morning, he finished his song at his leisure, and had the roof to himself as long as he chose to stay. 

No bird is more graceful than the cat-bird, and in spite of his sober dress of slate-color and black, none is more beautiful. His plumage may be grave of hue, but it is like satin in sheen and texture, and always in the most perfect order, for he takes the daintiest care of himself. To see him make his toilet for the night is well worth staying late and eating a cold dinner. For an hour without ceasing will he plume himself, carefully dressing each feather many times over, combing his head with his claws again and again, and shaking with violent effort every atom of the day's dust from him. Then when all is arranged to his mind, and every feather in place, he fluffs himself out into a ball, draws one slate-colored foot up out of sight into its feather pillow, and is ready to say good-night and enjoy his repose. 

Another sight, for which one must lose his breakfast — though it will be well exchanged — is his bath. The cat-bird loves water, and he plunges in, fluttering and spattering in a way to delight the soul of a "hydromaniac," wings and tail and head all hard at work, sprinkling everything for yards around, till when he steps out he looks like an animated rag-bag, and the long, careful toilet of the evening is repeated. 

But the rarest of all is to see him take a sunbath, and one is fortunate indeed to catch sight of him and not disturb him in his luxurious enjoyment. Each particular feather stands on end, even to the small ones of his crown, till he looks twice his usual size, and like a clumsy imitation of a bird made of feathers stuck loosely into a ball. More than this, he leans far over on one side, and lifts his wing so that the sunshine may penetrate to every part, while his mouth is half open and his eyes are closed in ecstasy. He is a strange-looking object; one would think him in great distress rather than enjoying a sunning. 

It is interesting to watch the various attitudes this bird assumes. He even seems to change shape. Now he stretches up very tall, with neck lengthened and tail standing at an angle of forty-five degrees; again he crouches in a heap, and swells out till he resembles an exaggerated wren; something attracts his attention, and he leans forward with head and tail on a level with his body, and legs closely curled under him, till he looks from the front like a snake; a thought of mischief seizes him, and he drops his tail over on one side, lowers his head, spreads far apart his sturdy legs, and the looker-on may be sure that in a moment he will dart off to frighten away another bird, or play some lively prank. 

No words can express contempt or a shrug of the shoulder better than a certain upward, sideways jerk of the tail and saucy twitch of the body which he will give to signify his opinion of the song of some other bird; wide-awake interest is never more clearly displayed than by the jerks of body and rustling switches of the tail with which he contemplates a strange sight. He is alive to the tips of his toes, every movement is so alert, so unexpected; he will start off as if intending to fly a mile, and bring up on the next twig, a foot away; standing quietly on a branch as though settled for life, suddenly, like a flash, he will slip off the other side, and dive after a berry or a worm his sharp eyes have seen. 

I had a great desire to find a nest, so when I saw a cat-bird go several times in one direction, worm in mouth, I watched closely. The bird hopped all around the bush, eying me sharply, and at last jumped upon the lowest branch, gave me one last glance, slipped to the ground on the other side, and returned in a moment without the worm. 

"Now," I said, exultingly — "now I have you!" 

Carefully I crept up and parted the branches, while the disturbed bird liopped from twig to twig, saying ''Quit! quit!" I looked in, confidently expecting to see the low nest I knew so well. No nest was there. Then I searched the neighboring shrubs, and even the grass around, but no sign of his home could I find, while the bird, who had watched and followed me, plainly chuckled in a way that said, "Humph ! you missed it, didn't you?" and I firmly believe that the saucy fellow ate the worm himself, and went through all that pretense of mystery to mislead me and rebuke my prying curiosity. 

The singing of the cat-bird is as characteristic as anything else about him. No song of his ever comes from the top of a tall tree, where the robin delights to pour out his inspiring notes, but out of the deepest shade of the thickest shrub his music salutes the ear. It is the most charming of songs, exquisite in quality, and of compass and variety. His common chirp as he goes about in the bushes is soft as raindrops plashing into a quiet lake, and his low  chatter to his friends has the same liquid character. But he has harsher tones; he has a sharp "tut, tut," like the robin, and he has the cry from which he is named, which at a little distance somewhat resembles the "mew " of a melancholy cat, but closer sounds more like the cry of a young baby. Then, also, when his anger is roused, and he flies furiously almost in one's face, he gives utterance to a harsh, grating sound that one finds it hard to believe can come out of his mouth, like "Crack-rack-rack." In fact, I do not know a bird possessing a greater variety of notes. 

When a cat-bird stands up three feet from you, not in the least flustered or disturbed, calmly looking you full in the face with both his bright black eyes, not turning his head from side to side in the way common to birds, you recognize in him something like intelligence and reason, and you cannot resist the conviction that he has his opinions, and could express them if only you could understand his language.
